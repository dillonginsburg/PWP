## Milestone 1 Feedback

Good work - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are straight forward and to the point. It would be nice to have a little more detail with your audience. It says the site is fashioned for people and orgs. around the world, but what types of people? What types of organizations? This will help the scope of your project and fine tune who you're trying to market towards. Think about this a little more as you move into the next phases of your PWP.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks good too.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.
