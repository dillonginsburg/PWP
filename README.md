# PWP

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Good work - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are straight forward and to the point. It would be nice to have a little more detail with your audience. It says the site is fashioned for people and orgs. around the world, but what types of people? What types of organizations? This will help the scope of your project and fine tune who you're trying to market towards. Think about this a little more as you move into the next phases of your PWP.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks good too.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.

## Milestone 3 Feedback

All of this feedback is only on the site that you gave me.  
* There's too much placeholder content.  Morty is funny and all, but you need to fix that.
* In the same vein, there's not enough content here.  You need more than a sentence of about me, and same for your portfolio.
* Your contact form overlaps with your carousel.  I can't even click the name field to enter something there.
* You should have a background for your menu, and similar with your portfolio title.  Black on dark blue is too hard to read and a complete no-no for low-vision individuals.
* The contact form is broken.  Even if SendGrid is not working, I should still see a graceful degradation to your site, rather than an error when I submit the form.
* Your jump menu points to the wrong places.
* You know this already, but the mobile version needs work.  Your titles should resize, there's a huge amount of whitespace after your main page, and again, your menu could use a background so that it's discernible from your main page.
* Your git commit messages, when present, are good, but the project needs more commits.  I understand that this is due to the fact that you had work in other places, but employers will look at that and have real WTF moments if they see it.

Overall, this is currently a Tier I submission.  That's insufficient for this to pass.  I'm going to be discussing steps going forward on what you will need to do to fix this.  This will need to happen before Friday in order for you to receive your certificate.
